## Prerequisites (for development)

- Node.js (v20 or higher)
- npm (comes with Node.js)
- Windows build tools if you are on Windows
  - Modern Node.js installations include the necessary build tools. If you encounter issues building native modules, ensure you selected the option to install build tools during Node.js installation, or reinstall Node.js with build tools enabled.
- iRacing installed on your machine (Windows only)

> Note: Developing on MacOS is fully supported and does not require iRacing or any additional tools to be installed as it uses a mocked SDK.

## Installation (for development)

To install IRDashies, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

4. Run the application:

```bash
npm start
```

5. Optionally, you can run the storybook to view the components in isolation:

```bash
npm run storybook
```

## Usage (for development)

To start using IRDashies, run the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

This will start the application.

Look for the application in your app tray.

> You will need to have Node.js installed on your machine to run the application. You can download it from [here](https://nodejs.org/).

> On macOS you will see mocked data from a sample session. To connect to iRacing, you will need to run the application on Windows.

While developing its recommended you run storybook as it gives you a quick way to iterate your changes:

```bash
npm run storybook
```

## Folder Structure

The project is structured as follows:

```
irdashies/
  ├── src/
  │   ├── app/
  │   ├── frontend/
  │   ├── types/
```

- `src/app/` contains the main Electron application code.
- `src/app/irsdk/` contains the iRacing SDK code including the native C++ bindings.
- `src/frontend/` contains the React components for the overlays.
- `src/types/` contains TypeScript type definitions shared between the frontend and backend (e.g. telemetry types).

> Note: Frontend components should NOT import anything from ./app as these are Electron-specific modules. Any communication should be done via IPC and types exposed via the types folder.

## Storybook

To view the components in Storybook, run the following command:

```bash
npm run storybook
```

This allows you to easily develop, test, and visualise the widgets/overlays in isolation.

## Package (create .exe)

To package the application and create the .exe, run the following command:

```bash
npm run package
```

To create the .exe and the installer run the following:

```bash
npm run make
```

## Testing

To run the tests, run the following command:

```bash
npm run test
```

## Linting

To run the linting, run the following command:

```bash
npm run lint
```

> Ensure you have ESLint extension installed if using VS Code. This project uses ESLint flat config format (eslint.config.mjs).

## Developing on Mac

As you may know, the iRacing SDK is only available on Windows. To develop on Mac OS, there is a mock SDK that is loaded which generates some dummy data for you to work with. This is useful for developing the UI components and widgets.

## Acknowledgments

This project makes use of data and resources from the following projects:

- **[lovely-car-data](https://github.com/Lovely-Sim-Racing/lovely-car-data)** - Comprehensive car telemetry data including RPM thresholds, LED configurations, and shift point information for various racing games.
- **[lovely-track-data](https://github.com/Lovely-Sim-Racing/lovely-track-data)** - Per-track corner names, sectors, pit-lane markers, and named straights for various racing games.
